bigram_model.py

This Python file implements a bigram language model using a small training corpus. It calculates unigram and bigram counts, estimates probabilities, and computes sentence probabilities. It also compares sentences to determine which one is more likely.

metrics.py

This script computes precision and recall from a multi-class confusion matrix. It calculates per-class metrics as well as macro and micro averages. The results help evaluate the performance of a classification system.

Writing Calculation.pdf

This file contains the written answers for all theory and calculation questions in the assignment. It includes step-by-step solutions for classification, bigram probabilities, backoff models, and evaluation metrics. It shows my understanding of key NLP concepts.
