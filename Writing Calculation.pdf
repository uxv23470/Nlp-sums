Q1. Document Classification: “predictable no fun”

We compute Naïve Bayes scores:

P(class∣doc)∝P(class)∏P(word∣class)
Positive score

Score pos=0.5×0.10×0.05×0.02

Step by step:

0.10 × 0.05 = 0.005

0.005 × 0.02 = 0.0001

0.0001 × 0.5 = 0.00005

Score pos=5×10−5
🔹 Negative score

Score neg=0.5×0.40×0.30×0.25

Step by step:

0.40 × 0.30 = 0.12

0.12 × 0.25 = 0.03

0.03 × 0.5 = 0.015

Q2. Harms of Classification
1️ Representational Harm

Definition:
When a system reinforces stereotypes or portrays a group unfairly.

Kiritchenko & Mohammad (2018)
They showed sentiment models rated sentences containing words linked
 to women or minorities more negatively than identical sentences with neutral words.


2️ Risk of Censorship in Toxicity Systems

From Dixon et al. (2018); Oliva et al. (2021):

 Toxicity classifiers often flag identity terms (e.g., “gay”, “Muslim”) as toxic.

Risk:
Legitimate speech by marginalized communities gets suppressed.

3️ Why Classifiers Perform Worse on AAE or Indian English

Reasons include:

Training data dominated by Standard American English

Dialect grammar differs (not errors)

Vocabulary & syntax differs

Key issue: linguistic diversity ≠ poor language.

 Q3. Bigram Probabilities
1️ Sentence Probabilities (MLE)
S1: <s> I love NLP </s>

P=P(I∣<s>)×P(love∣I)×P(NLP∣love)×P(</s>∣NLP)

From counts:

P(I|<s>) = 2/3

P(love|I) = 2/2 = 1

P(NLP|love) = 1/2

P(</s>|NLP) = 1/1 = 1


P(S1)=32×1×21×1=31≈0.333
S2: <s> I love deep learning </s>

P=32×1×21×1×21

Step-by-step:

deep|love = 1/2

learning|deep = 2/2 = 1

</s>|learning = 1/2

P(S2)=32×1×21×1×21=61≈0.167
 More probable sentence

S1 is more probable (0.333 > 0.167)

2️ Zero-Probability Problem
🔹 MLE

Counts after "ate": 6+3+2+1 = 12

P(noodle∣ate)=0
 Why this is a problem

If any word has probability 0:

P(sentence)=0

This breaks:

sentence scoring

perplexity calculations

🔹 Laplace smoothing

P=12+100+1=221≈0.045
✅ Q4. Backoff Model
1️ P(cats | I like)

Trigram count:
I like cats = 1
I like total = 2

P=1/2=0.5
2️ P(dogs | You like)

Trigram unseen → backoff to bigram:

P(dogs∣like)=1/3
3️ Why backoff is necessary

Because many trigrams never appear in small corpora.
Backoff prevents zero probabilities.

✅ Q5. Confusion Matrix Metrics

Matrix:

System\Gold	Cat	Dog	Rabbit
Cat	5	10	5
Dog	15	20	10
Rabbit	0	15	10
1️ Per-Class Precision & Recall
 Cat

Precision = 5 / (5+10+5) = 5/20 = 0.25

Recall = 5 / (5+15+0) = 5/20 = 0.25

 Dog

Precision = 20 / (15+20+10) = 20/45 ≈ 0.44

Recall = 20 / (10+20+15) = 20/45 ≈ 0.44

 Rabbit

Precision = 10 / (5+10+10) = 10/25 = 0.40

Recall = 10 / (5+10+10) = 10/25 = 0.40

2️ Macro vs Micro
Macro Average
Precision=(0.25+0.44+0.40)/3≈0.36
Recall=(0.25+0.44+0.40)/3≈0.36
Micro Average

Total TP = 5+20+10 = 35
Total predictions = 90
Total actual = 90

Micro Precision=35/90≈0.39

Micro Recall=35/90≈0.39
Difference

Macro: treats all classes equally

Micro: favors frequent classes
